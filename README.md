# Node Test Runner

This is an example of loading client side script into a JSDOM and testing on a node server.

---

## Installation

Installation: `npm install`


## Usage

* Run the index.js using babel node: `babel-node .`
* It will load the script in the `src` folder and then all the `*spec.js` files in the `test` folder.
* Events will be emitted that could be used to calculate pass and fails.
* JQuery or other libraries could be added to make more complex assertions.


## Tests

Run tests using Mocha: `npm test`
